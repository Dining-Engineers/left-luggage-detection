Combination of proposals
-------------------------
Given the two sets of bounding box obtained through the processing of 
depth and intensity video streams, we compute the following pairwise 
overlap ratios:

:math:`r = \frac{area \left(B_{curr} \cap B_{acc} \right)}{area \left(B_{curr} \cup B_{acc} \right)}`
